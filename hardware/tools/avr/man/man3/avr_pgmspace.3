.PP
The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device. In order to use these functions, the target device must support either the \fCLPM\fP or \fCELPM\fP instructions.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between different compilers easier. This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).
.PP
If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram, use the standard string functions described in \fB<string.h>: Strings\fP.
.PP
If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use \fBpgm_read_byte_near()\fP or \fBpgm_read_word_near()\fP instead of \fBpgm_read_byte_far()\fP or \fBpgm_read_word_far()\fP since it is more efficient that way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code. All functions that are suffixed with a \fC_P\fP \fIrequire\fP their arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do not use ELPM instructions. This is normally not a big concern as the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code. However, it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM. \fIAll these functions will not work in that situation.\fP

.SS "size_t strnlen_P (PGM_P src, size_t len)"
.PP
Determine the length of a fixed-size string. 
.PP
The \fBstrnlen_P()\fP function is similar to \fBstrnlen()\fP, except that \fCsrc\fP is a pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The strnlen_P function returns strlen_P(src), if that is less than \fClen\fP, or \fClen\fP if there is no '\\0' character among the first \fClen\fP characters pointed to by \fCsrc\fP.

.SS "char * strpbrk_P (const char * s, PGM_P accept)"
.PP
The \fBstrpbrk_P()\fP function locates the first occurrence in the string \fCs\fP of any of the characters in the flash string \fCaccept\fP. This function is similar to \fBstrpbrk()\fP except that \fCaccept\fP is a pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrpbrk_P()\fP function returns a pointer to the character in \fCs\fP that matches one of the characters in \fCaccept\fP, or \fCNULL\fP if no such character is found. The terminating zero is not considered as a part of string: if one or both args are empty, the result will \fCNULL\fP.

.SS "PGM_P strrchr_P (PGM_P s, int val)"
.PP
Locate character in string. 
.PP
The \fBstrrchr_P()\fP function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character \fCval\fP in the flash string \fCs\fP.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrrchr_P()\fP function returns a pointer to the matched character or \fCNULL\fP if the character is not found.

.SS "char * strsep_P (char ** sp, PGM_P delim)"
.PP
Parse a string into tokens. 
.PP
The \fBstrsep_P()\fP function locates, in the string referenced by \fC*sp\fP, the first occurrence of any character in the string \fCdelim\fP (or the terminating '\\0' character) and replaces it with a '\\0'. The location of the next character after the delimiter character (or \fCNULL\fP, if the end of the string was reached) is stored in \fC*sp\fP. An ``empty'' field, i.e. one caused by two adjacent delimiter characters, can be detected by comparing the location referenced by the pointer returned in \fC*sp\fP to '\\0'. This function is similar to \fBstrsep()\fP except that \fCdelim\fP is a pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrsep_P()\fP function returns a pointer to the original value of \fC*sp\fP. If \fC*sp\fP is initially \fCNULL\fP, \fBstrsep_P()\fP returns \fCNULL\fP. 
.RE

.SS "size_t strspn_P (const char * s, PGM_P accept)"
.PP
The \fBstrspn_P()\fP function calculates the length of the initial segment of \fCs\fP which consists entirely of characters in \fCaccept\fP. This function is similar to \fBstrspn()\fP except that \fCaccept\fP is a pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrspn_P()\fP function returns the number of characters in the initial segment of \fCs\fP which consist only of characters from \fCaccept\fP. The terminating zero is not considered as a part of string. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "char * strstr_P (const char * s1, PGM_P s2)"
.PP
Locate a substring. 
.PP
The \fBstrstr_P()\fP function finds the first occurrence of the substring \fCs2\fP in the string \fCs1\fP. The terminating '\\0' characters are not compared. The \fBstrstr_P()\fP function is similar to \fBstrstr()\fP except that \fCs2\fP is pointer to a string in program space.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The \fBstrstr_P()\fP function returns a pointer to the beginning of the substring, or NULL if the substring is not found. If \fCs2\fP points to a string of zero length, the function returns \fCs1\fP.
