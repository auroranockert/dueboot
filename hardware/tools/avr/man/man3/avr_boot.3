The macros in this module provide a C language interface to the bootloader support functionality of certain AVR processors. These macros are designed to work with all sizes of flash memory.
.PP
Global interrupts are not automatically disabled for these macros. It is left up to the programmer to do this. See the code example below. Also see the processor datasheet for caveats on having global interrupts enabled during writing of the Flash.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Not all AVR processors provide bootloader support. See your processor datasheet to see if it provides bootloader support.
.RE
.PP
\fBTodo\fP
.RS 4
From email with Marek: On smaller devices (all except ATmega64/128), __SPM_REG is in the I/O space, accessible with the shorter 'in' and 'out' instructions - since the boot loader has a limited size, this could be an important optimization.

.SS "#define boot_lock_bits_set(lock_bits)   __boot_lock_bits_set(lock_bits)"
.PP
Set the bootloader lock bits.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIlock_bits\fP A mask of which Boot Loader Lock Bits to set.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
In this context, a 'set bit' will be written to a zero value. Note also that only BLBxx bits can be programmed by this command.
.RE
.PP
For example, to disallow the SPM instruction from writing to the Boot Loader memory section of flash, you would use this macro as such:
.PP
.PP
.nf
    boot_lock_bits_set (_BV (BLB11));
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Like any lock bits, the Boot Loader Lock Bits, once set, cannot be cleared again except by a chip erase which will in turn also erase the boot loader itself.

Fill the bootloader temporary page buffer for flash address with data word.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
The address is a byte address. The data is a word. The AVR writes data to the buffer a word at a time, but addresses the buffer per byte! So, increment your address by 2 between calls, and send 2 data bytes in a word format! The LSB of the data is written to the lower address; the MSB of the data is written to the higher address.
