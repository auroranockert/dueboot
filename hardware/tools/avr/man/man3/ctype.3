.SS "int isalnum (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for an alphanumeric character. It is equivalent to \fC(isalpha(c) || isdigit(c))\fP. 
.SS "int isalpha (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for an alphabetic character. It is equivalent to \fC(isupper(c) || islower(c))\fP. 
.SS "int isascii (int __c)"
.PP
Checks whether \fCc\fP is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the ASCII character set. 
.SS "int isblank (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for a blank character, that is, a space or a tab. 
.SS "int iscntrl (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for a control character. 
.SS "int isdigit (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for a digit (0 through 9). 
.SS "int isgraph (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for any printable character except space. 
.SS "int islower (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for a lower-case character. 
.SS "int isprint (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for any printable character including space. 
.SS "int ispunct (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for any printable character which is not a space or an alphanumeric character. 
.SS "int isspace (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for white-space characters. For the avr-libc library, these are: space, form-feed ('\\f'), newline ('\\n'), carriage return ('\\r'), horizontal tab ('\\t'), and vertical tab ('\\v'). 
.SS "int isupper (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for an uppercase letter. 
.SS "int isxdigit (int __c)"
.PP
Checks for a hexadecimal digits, i.e. one of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f A B C D E F. 
.SS "int toascii (int __c)"
.PP
Converts \fCc\fP to a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the ASCII character set, by clearing the high-order bits.
.PP
\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
Many people will be unhappy if you use this function. This function will convert accented letters into random characters.

.PP

.SS "int tolower (int __c)"
.PP
Converts the letter \fCc\fP to lower case, if possible. 
.SS "int toupper (int __c)"
.PP
Converts the letter \fCc\fP to upper case, if possible.
