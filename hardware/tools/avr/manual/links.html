<h1>Links</h1>
This section lists software packages and sites which may be useful for people working with the AVR.

<h2><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" target="_blank">Barebone's TextWrangler</a></h2>
This is a text editor. We list it here because it's a powerful programming editor and it's free. If you don't want to install Xcode, you probably want TextWrangler for source code editing.

<h2><a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Smultron</a></h2>
This is another text editor. This one is not only free, it is also Open Source. Some people prefer it over TextWrangler.

<h2><a href="http://palmavr.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/fc.cgi" target="_blank">AVR Fuse Calculator</a></h2>
This web site is an interactive fuse value calculator for AVR devices. You choose the desired options from pop-up menus or checkboxes and it tells you the hexadecimal fuse values to be used with AVRDUDE.

<h2><a href="http://www.vonnieda.org/AVRFuses/" target="_blank">AVRFuses</a></h2>
This native Mac application is a GUI frontend for AVRDUDE, the uploader/downloader tool which ships with AVRMacPack. AVRFuses, as the name suggests, contains a fuse value calculator for user friendly feature selection. AVRFuses is free!

<h2><a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/" target="_blank">AVR-USB</a></h2>
Objective Development has a USB library for AVR microcontrollers. This library implements low speed USB device functionality without special hardware resources. Only one edge triggered interrupt is required. This library is free (Gnu General Public License version 2).

<h2><a href="http://winavr.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WinAVR</a></h2>
As the name suggests, WinAVR is a binary distribution for Windows. It contains a basic set of Unix tools in order to use Makefiles, gcc in version 4, GNU binutils, AVRDUDE, gdb, avarice, simulavr and a couple of GUI tools such as Programmer's Notepad. Unfortunately, the latest versions of WinAVR do not include gcc version 3 which builds somewhat more efficient code than version 4. Version 20060125 was the last which came with gcc 3.
